# Houdini Engine for Unity - Package Version
This is a fork of the [Houdini Engine for Unity plug-in](https://github.com/sideeffects/HoudiniEngineForUnity) that packages it as a [Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html) compatible with the Package Manager, instead of the traditional Unity package format that would pollute the Assets folder.

## Installation
To install the Houdini Engine for Unity Package, follow these steps:

1. Open Unity.
2. Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager).
3. Click the "âž•" button in the top-left corner of the Package Manager window.
4. Select "Add package from git URL..." from the dropdown menu.
5. Enter the following URL: https://github.com/melMass/com.sidefx.houdiniengine.git
6. Click "Add" and wait for Unity to import the package.

## Usage
Once the package is installed, you can use Houdini Digital Assets in Unity like any other Unity asset. Simply drag and drop the Houdini Digital Asset (.hdalc) file into your Unity scene, adjust its parameters using the Inspector window, and run the game to see the results.
Checkout the great documentation of the plugin for further details.
